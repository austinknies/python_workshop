Three main types of unethical behavior are examined: (1) falsification of research; (2) expropriation of graduate student research or including an undeserving co-author on a research paper; and(3) exchange of grades for gifts, money, or sex. Using a unique data set gathered at the 1998 American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, we find that there is a significant amount of misconduct, particularly in the second category.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-heading\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"/paper/2235/\">Achievement Awards For High School Matriculation: Evidence From Randomized Trials<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></span></a>\\n                            \\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"Achievement awards for high school matriculation: Evidence from randomized trials\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Angrist Joshua D\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Lavy Victor \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2003\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_journal_title\" content=\"Working Papers\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_pdf_url\" content=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00202.pdf\">\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-8\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoshua D Angrist,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVictor Lavy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCited by*: 1 Downloads*: 40 <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/feb/natura/00202.html\"><img src=\"/static/library/gif/pdficon_small.png\"/></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Israel, as in many other countries, a high school matriculation certificate is required by universities and some jobs. In spite of the certificate&#39;s value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-heading\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"/paper/2045/\">Actions And Beliefs: Estimating Distribution-Based Preferences Using A Large Scale Experiment With Probability Questions On Expectations<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></span></a>\\n                            \\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"Actions and beliefs: Estimating distribution-based preferences using a large scale experiment with probability questions on expectations\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Bellemare Charles \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Kroger Sabine \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"van Soest Arthur \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2005\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_journal_title\" content=\"Working Papers\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_pdf_url\" content=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00007.pdf\">\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-8\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCharles Bellemare,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSabine Kroger,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArthur van Soest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCited by*: 3 Downloads*: 9 <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/feb/artefa/00007.html\"><img src=\"/static/library/gif/pdficon_small.png\"/></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe combine the choice data of proposers and responders in the ultimatum game, their expectations elicited in the form of subjective probability questions, and the choice data of proposers (dictators) in a dictator game to estimate a structural model of decision making under uncertainty. We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-heading\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"/paper/2365/\">Active Decisions And Pro-Social Behavior: A Field Experiment On Blood Donation<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></span></a>\\n                            \\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"Active decisions and pro-social behavior: A field experiment on blood donation\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Goette Lorenz \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Stutzer Alois \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Zehnder Michael \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2007\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_journal_title\" content=\"Working Papers\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_pdf_url\" content=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00335.pdf\">\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-8\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLorenz Goette,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlois Stutzer,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMichael Zehnder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCited by*: 0 Downloads*: 34 <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/feb/natura/00335.html\"><img src=\"/static/library/gif/pdficon_small.png\"/></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this paper, we propose a decision framework where people are individually asked to either actively consent or dissent to some pro-social behavior. We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation. We find that this &quot;active-decision&quot; intervention substantially increases the stated willingness to donate blood, as well as the actual donation behavior of people who have not fully formed preferences beforehand.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-heading\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"/paper/2566/\">A Dollar For Your Thoughts: Feedback-Conditional Rebates On Ebay<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></span></a>\\n                            \\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"A dollar for your thoughts: Feedback-conditional rebates on eBay\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Cabral Luis \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Li Lingfang \">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2015\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_journal_title\" content=\"Management Science\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_volume\" content=\"61\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_issue\" content=\"9\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_firstpage\" content=\"2052\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_lastpage\" content=\"2063\">\\n\\n<meta name=\"citation_pdf_url\" content=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00578.pdf\">\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-8\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLuis Cabral,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLingfang Li\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCited by*: 1 Downloads*: 41 <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/feb/natura/00578.html\"><img src=\"/static/library/gif/pdficon_small.png\"/></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"row\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe run a series of controlled field experiments on eBay where buyers are re-warded for providing feedback. Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer&#39;s rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller&#39;s &quot;good deeds&quot; (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can &quot;buy&quot; feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul class=\"pager\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>1 of 70</li>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"?page=2\">Next</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-group\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"panel-footer\">*Paper statistics provided by <a href=\"http://logec.repec.org/\">LogEc</a></div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"footer\">\\n<div class=\"container\">\\n    <div class=\"row\">\\n        <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-5\">\\n            <h6 class=\"text-muted\">List et al 2019</h6>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n    <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap\\'s JavaScript plugins) -->\\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js\"></script>\\n\\n    <!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->\\n    <script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\\n\\n\\n</body>\\n\\n<!-- Google Analytics -->\\n<script>\\n\\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\\n  })(window,document,\\'script\\',\\'//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\',\\'ga\\');\\n\\n  ga(\\'create\\', \\'UA-38115535-1\\', \\'auto\\');\\n  ga(\\'send\\', \\'pageview\\');\\n\\n</script>\\n</html>\\n'"

Three main types of unethical behavior are examined: (1) falsification of research; (2) expropriation of graduate student research or including an undeserving co-author on a research paper; and(3) exchange of grades for gifts, money, or sex. Using a unique data set gathered at the 1998 American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, we find that there is a significant amount of misconduct, particularly in the second category.\n",

      "          In Israel, as in many other countries, a high school matriculation certificate is required by universities and some jobs. In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.\n",

      "          In this paper, we propose a decision framework where people are individually asked to either actively consent or dissent to some pro-social behavior. We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation. We find that this \"active-decision\" intervention substantially increases the stated willingness to donate blood, as well as the actual donation behavior of people who have not fully formed preferences beforehand.\n",

      "          We run a series of controlled field experiments on eBay where buyers are re-warded for providing feedback. Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.\n",

Three main types of unethical behavior are examined: (1) falsification of research; (2) expropriation of graduate student research or including an undeserving co-author on a research paper; and(3) exchange of grades for gifts, money, or sex. Using a unique data set gathered at the 1998 American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, we find that there is a significant amount of misconduct, particularly in the second category.<br>\n",

       " \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Israel, as in many other countries, a high school matriculation certificate is required by universities and some jobs. In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br>\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br>\n",

We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation. We find that this \"active-decision\" intervention substantially increases the stated willingness to donate blood, as well as the actual donation behavior of people who have not fully formed preferences beforehand.<br>\n",

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",

In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br>\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br>\n",

We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation.

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",

Using a unique data set gathered at the 1998 American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, we find that there is a significant amount of misconduct, particularly in the second category.<br>\n",

In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br>\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br>\n",

We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation. We find that this \"active-decision\" intervention substantially increases the stated willingness to donate blood, as well as the actual donation behavior of people who have not fully formed preferences beforehand.<br>\n",

       " \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe run a series of controlled field experiments on eBay where buyers are re-warded for providing feedback. Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",

       " \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Israel, as in many other countries, a high school matriculation certificate is required by universities and some jobs. In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br>\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br>\n",

We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation. We find that this \"active-decision\" intervention substantially increases the stated willingness to donate blood, as well as the actual donation behavior of people who have not fully formed preferences beforehand.<br>\n",

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback.

Three main types of unethical behavior are examined: (1) falsification of research; (2) expropriation of graduate student research or including an undeserving co-author on a research paper; and(3) exchange of grades for gifts, money, or sex. Using a unique data set gathered at the 1998 American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, we find that there is a significant amount of misconduct, particularly in the second category.<br>\n",

In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work, or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.<br>\n",

We use a large and representative sample of subjects drawn from the Dutch population. Our results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for equity in the population. Changes in preferences have an important impact on decisions of dictators in the dictator game and responders in the ultimatum game, but a smaller impact on decisions of proposers in the ultimatum game, a result due to proposers subjective expectations about responders decisions. The model which uses subjective data on expectations has better predictive power and lower noise level than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.<br>\n",

We hypothesize that confronting individuals with the choice of engaging in a specific pro-social behavior contributes to the formation of issue-specific altruistic preferences while simultaneously involving a commitment. The hypothesis is tested in a large-scale field experiment on blood donation.

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyer's rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower trans-action quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the seller's \"good deeds\" (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can \"buy\" feedback, but such feedback is likely to be biased.<br>\n",
